## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

**Environment setup (with pyenv + virtualenv):**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the API**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```


### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)

**install Dependencies**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Run dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```


üóÑÔ∏è Database
	‚Ä¢	Default dev DB is SQLite (backend/betlog.db).
	‚Ä¢	For production, you can switch to Postgres by updating database.py + Alembic config.



AI Assistant

How it works
	1.	You type a prompt/question into the textarea.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWrite Python code for calculating payout with American odds.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúExplain how expected value works in betting.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúGenerate SQL to query all bets with profit > 100.‚Äù
	2.	Your React frontend (AIDemo.jsx) sends that prompt to your backend via /ai.
	3.	FastAPI backend (ai.py) forwards it to OpenAI (GPT-4.1-mini) using your API key.
	4.	OpenAI generates a response (text, code, explanation).
	5.	The response comes back to your React app ‚Üí rendered in your ‚ÄúAsk BetLog AI‚Äù panel (with code highlighting if applicable).



Backend

FastAPI bootstraps the app, auto-creates SQLite tables from SQLAlchemy models, wires routers, and enables the Vite dev origin to call the API (backend/app/main.py:8-25).
Bet and ArbGroup models capture individual wagers plus optional arbitrage grouping, including derived metrics like decimal odds, payout, and cumulative PnL (backend/app/models.py:18-43).
Core calculations convert American/decimal odds, handle bonus bets and open wagers, recompute payouts and running PnL for every bet after any mutation, and estimate group-wide arbitrage profit (backend/app/utils.py:9-121).
The /bets endpoints support CRUD, recalc all bets after each change, and when a bet is marked as part of an arbitrage group they recompute the shared guaranteed profit for that group (backend/app/api/bets.py:21-143).
Arbitrage routes let you create/list groups, fetch a group with its legs and realized profit, and return a summary aggregated by group ID (backend/app/api/arbitrage.py:25-101).
/ai proxies prompts to OpenAI‚Äôs Chat Completions API (model gpt-4.1-mini) using an env-provided API key, returning either the reply text or the error (backend/app/api/ai.py:19-28).

Frontend

The top-level React component loads bets on mount, keeps them in state, and renders the entry form, editable table, and AI helper panel (frontend/src/App.jsx:8-42).
Axios helpers centralize HTTP calls to the FastAPI backend for bets CRUD and AI requests (frontend/src/api.js:4-13).
BetForm is a controlled form that casts numeric fields appropriately, supports marking wagers as bonus or arbitrage legs, and resets after posting a new bet (frontend/src/components/BetForm.jsx:5-198).
BetTable surfaces portfolio KPIs (total PnL, stake, win %, ROI), lists bets with color-coded status, lets you inline-edit records (including arbitrage flags/group IDs), delete bets, and renders arbitrage group cards underneath (frontend/src/components/BetTable.jsx:547-777).
ArbSummaryCard derives stake, profit, and payout per leg, then reports aggregate stake and net profit percentage for each arbitrage group (frontend/src/components/ArbSummaryCard.jsx:80-155).
AIDemo posts free-form prompts to /ai, stores the reply, and highlights any code block returned by the model (frontend/src/components/AIDemo.jsx:6-55).
